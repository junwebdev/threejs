    <!-- Introduction -->
    <div class="feature-description">
      <h1>Hello everyone</h1>
      <p>
        This is a demonstration of Three.js, a popular JavaScript library for
        creating 3D graphics in web applications. Three.js provides a simple yet
        powerful API for creating and manipulating 3D objects, applying textures
        and materials, setting up lighting, and animating scenes. With Three.js,
        developers can easily integrate 3D graphics into their web projects,
        ranging from simple visualizations to immersive experiences. We've
        utilized several key features of Three.js in this demo:
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Feature 1: 3D Modeling -->
    <div class="feature-description" style="top: 220px">
      <h2>3D Modeling</h2>
      <p>
        I've created 3D models of a cube, Earth, and Moon using Three.js's
        geometry classes.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Feature 2: Texture Mapping -->
    <div class="feature-description" style="top: 320px">
      <h2>Texture Mapping</h2>
      <p>
        Textures are applied to the 3D models to add realism. Image textures for
        the Earth and Moon are loaded and applied to their respective materials.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Feature 3: Lighting and Shadows -->
    <div class="feature-description" style="top: 420px">
      <h2>Lighting and Shadows</h2>
      <p>
        Directional light sources simulate sunlight, enhancing the appearance of
        3D objects and casting shadows on the scene.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Feature 4: Animations -->
    <div class="feature-description" style="top: 520px">
      <h2>Animations</h2>
      <p>
        Rotation animations for the cube, Earth, and Moon are implemented using
        JavaScript's requestAnimationFrame() method. Additionally, the Moon
        orbits around the Earth using trigonometry calculations.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Feature 5: Interactivity -->
    <div class="feature-description" style="top: 620px">
      <h2>Interactivity</h2>
      <p>
        User interaction is enabled by allowing resizing of the window, which
        automatically adjusts the aspect ratio of the camera and renderer,
        ensuring a responsive 3D scene.
      </p>
