# Three.js Demo

This is a demonstration of Three.js, a JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in web applications. The project showcases various features of Three.js, including 3D modeling, texture mapping, lighting and shadows, animations, and interactivity.

## Features

- **3D Modeling:** Create 3D models of objects using Three.js's geometry classes.
- **Texture Mapping:** Apply textures to 3D models to add realism.
- **Lighting and Shadows:** Simulate lighting effects to enhance the appearance of 3D scenes.
- **Animations:** Implement dynamic animations for objects using JavaScript.
- **Interactivity:** Enable user interaction with the 3D scene, such as resizing the window and adjusting the aspect ratio.
